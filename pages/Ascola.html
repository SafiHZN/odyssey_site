            The Future Scientists Center’s alumni network was established to provide a professional and social framework for all of the Future Scientists Center’s programs’ and teams’ graduates, following their successful completion of their high school studies. The network strives to nurture them as they make their way to the forefront of science, technology, economics, and society, and take their place as the next generation of leaders of the State of Israel.

The goal of the network is to advance and integrate the alumni into pathways/tracks that match their capabilities and needs over the course of their careers, so as to realize their personal potential and develop their sense of belongingness and cohesion within a quality group of breakthrough leaders that serves as a resource for all of its members. The network strives to develop its alumni’s awareness and commitment to coping with challenges faced by the State of Israel. This network serves as an up-to-date, shared social space for all of our alumni, within which they voluntarily take part in activities, according to their individual preferences, traits, and worldviews. Alumni activities take place across members’ lifetimes – from the moment they graduate high school, through their IDF service and academic studies, and throughout their professional careers.
